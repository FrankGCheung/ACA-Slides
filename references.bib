	volume = {88},
	abstract = {The term binaural technique is used as a headline for methods for sound recording, synthesis and reproduction, where the sound pressure signals recorded (or synthesized) are the eardrum signals of the listener, and where successful reproduction is achieved, if these are truely reproduced in the ears of the listener. This paper shortly summarizes the main results of a series of investigations that are the current basis for the utilization of the binaural technique at Aalborg University and possibly elsewhere, including investigations on sound transmission in the ear canal, measurements of HRTFs (head-related transfer functions), calibration of headphones and localization experiments in real life and with binaural recordings from real heads and artificial heads.},
